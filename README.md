# IDG1293 Assignment 2

Assignment 2 consists of two parts:

Part 1 - Design for Animation

Part 2 - Introduction to GitHub, CSS Architecture and Accessibility



## Part 1 - Design for Animation 

In this part, you need to deliver a high fidelity sketch/prototype of Assignment 3.

The topic of your Assignment should reflect one of the Sustainability Goals from sdgs.un.org/goals.



The storyboard /prototype should consist of:

at least three scenes per student + intro page (min. ten scenes if your group consist of three members, min seven scenes if your group consist of two members)
annotations of the intended animations (as in the lecture about Designing for animations or if you are fluent in any prototyping tool it can be in the for of an interactive prototype)
your design must be a story and present a sketch/prototype of scrollytelling experience with animations (Lecture about storytelling/scrollytelling)
How it will be graded?

Imagine that you are a group of designers who could not pitch and present their design to the developers, you can only send the file to the developer. The developer must be able to develop the page, scrollytelling and animations based on your sketches/prototype.



## Part 2 - Introduction to GitHub, CSS Architecture and Accessibility

The second part of the Assignment proves your ability to use GitHub and build CSS Architecture.

create a repository on GitHub (how to create GitHub repository)
every group member needs to be listed in repository contributors (who is a contributor)
create README file (what is readme), in readme include:
What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Which technology is used
Who maintains and contributes to the project
prepare CSS Architecture (Lecture about CSS Architecture and Lecture about SASS)
create files necessary to implement separation of concern (some files can be empty - but think in advance what will be needed for Assignment 3, tip: sass files)
use BEM
use SASS or CSS Variables
every group member must contribute to the project through Git commit - push and pull requests
create a branch "master" for the main project (what are branches)
group members should create individual branches per implemented feature and merge changes through PR (pull request) (what are pull requests)
pull request should be reviewed and approved by group members (how to request pull request review, what is request review)
the owner of the branch should merge the changes to the master branch (how to merge changes)
commit animated with keyframes square (one animated square per student with different keyframe animation) (Lecture Shapes, Lecture Animations)
to implemented squares add the following @media queries (Lecture Accessibility)
prefers-reduced-motion
prefers-color-scheme
orientation
How is it going to be graded?

As a group and individual group member, you need to fulfil the above points + I will be looking at contributor insights and I will look at your commits. All group members must contribute to the readme file and commit an animated square from their own GitHub account.
