# UN's sustainable development goals; Goal 14

Goal 14 is about conserving and sustaining the use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sistainable development.

## What the project does

This project is created as part of assignment 2 in the course Advanced CSS IDG1293. It is created to show our scrollytelling abilities while also highlighting one of UN's sustainable development goals. We chose to highlight goal 14 which is about conserving and sustaining the use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sistainable development. The project works by the user scrolling down on a website, which will trigger different animations based on the goal we chose. The user will also be presented with facts about the different goals.

## Which technology is used

The technology we are using for this project is mainly SCSS and the Gsap animation building tool for javascript. We are using SCSS to style all the visible parts of the project, and create the animations which is used on the website. We are using GSAP to observe different elements and check if they are inside the viewport, and when they are inside the viewport we can select them to be animated. The animations are made up of a mix of css keyframe animations, and animations using the GSAP animation tool. The keyframe animations are stored in the _animations.svss file, and the GSAP animations are stored in the app.js file. We are also using the BEM naming convention for all our scss. BEM stands for **B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier, and is useful for maintaining similar naming conventions.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project

The project is mainly maintaned by the three of us who made the project. There are in total three contributors to this project, tijohans, DanielLillevik, and StormHansael. The project is open for contributions.
